                        <h2 class="allBoxHeader">All-Star Cheerleading</h2>
                        <p>All-Star Cheerleading is cheerleading where you are not physically “cheering” a “main sport” on, but rather
                           is the main sport itself. There are levels 1 to 7. Each team performs a 2 minute and 30 seconds routine
                           composed of four major elements. The elements are stunting, tumbling, jumps and dance. Stunting is where
                           the bases lift their flyers in a variety of creative positions that make up a partner stunt and includes
                           formation of pyramids and baskets (where you physically throw your flyer in the air, she completes a skill,
                           and you catch her). Tumbling is the flipping aspect of cheerleading with a variety of different skills such
                           as somersaults, cart-wheels, back hand springs and other gymanastics skills. There are running starts, where you perform a sequence of
                           moves across the floor or there is standing tumbling where you perform a shorter tumbling pass from a
                           stationary position. Jumps are simply a combination of different jumps performed by the team and are all
                           synchronized together. Finally, dance is the final component of your routine considered the “celebration”
                           at the end of your routine, where you perform a wide range of choreographed motions. There are three main
                           positions for team members. The roles are flyers, bases and thirds and I have been a third throughout my
                           cheerleading career. A flyer is the person who is thrown in the air and performs moves at the top of the
                           pyramid. A base is the person on either side of the stunt group holding the flyers by their feet.  A third
                           is the person on the back of the stunt group holding the flyers ankles for stability and power. In All-Star
                           cheerleading, teams develop and learn a routine through the season and use the same routine in competetions
                           throughout the year. As the season progresses, the routine gets upgraded to include more advanced moves and
                           skills. All of my years competing in All-Star Cheerleading have been with the Cheersport Sport Sharks facility
                           in Cambridge, Ontario.</p>

                        <h2 class="allBoxHeader">Varsity Cheerleading</h2>
                        <p>Varsity cheerleading is something that is more new to me, as this is my first year. I have joined Brock’s
                           cheerleading team but due to Covid 19, this has all been online thus far. There are a lot of the same or
                           similar components, such as stunting, jumps and tumbling but with a different aspect - Cheers! There are
                           two forms of varsity cheerleading. Gameday cheering is when you are cheering for other people in a support
                           role and you are not the main sport. In Brock’s case, the cheerleading team supports the basketball team.
                           There is also a competitive form of varsity cheerleading where your team is the main attraction. Last season,
                           the Brock team went to Florida to compete in the University World Cup Cheerleading Championships (UWCC). In
                           varsity cheerleading, the actual routine is 1 minute and 45 seconds and set to music, and the remainder of
                           the time is spent performing vocal cheers with signs and pompoms. Part of your score for varsity cheerleading
                           is based on the level of the crowd's engagement with your performance which is another difference from
                           All-Star cheerleading.</p>
