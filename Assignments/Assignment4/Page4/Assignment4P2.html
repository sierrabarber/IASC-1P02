                    <h2 class="mainContentHeaders" title="Silky Sharks was the first competitive All-Star team I was on. This was a large, all-girl, level 2 team (meaning that there were the max amount of athletes on the floor). A lot of the girls on this team were very new to the sport, including myself. The team competed in 7 different competitions in Canada and the US. Our biggest competition was in Myrtle Beach at the end of our season. I was only on this team for my first year and provided me a great foundation for my future years of cheerleading.">

                    <h2 class="mainContentHeaders" title="Hammerhead Sharks (also known as Hammers) was the next team that I was on, it was a large, all girl, level 4.2 team. The level 4.2 means that we stunted at level 4 but we tumbled at level 2 (meaning back handsprings used in combination with simpler skills for variation), this was perfect for me as tumbling was never my favourite aspect of the sport. I was on this team for two seasons, and we completed the whole first season undefeated, winning every competition we attended, except for the one in Atlanta, Georgia (as Canadian teams have a harder time competing against American teams). The second season we had another great run, although we did not win every competition we were close to being undefeated. This team was where I truly fell in love with cheerleading, and met some amazing people that I am still friends with today.">Hammers</h2>

                    <h2 class="mainContentHeaders" title="Copper Sharks was my first ever worlds team, meaning that as long as we got a big (invitation) we got to compete at the World Championships, which is the biggest competition in all of cheerleading. Coppers is a level 5.0 team, meaning International Open, All Girl, level 5.0 team, again level 5 (worlds level) stunting but no tumbling at all, again a dream come true for me because tumbling really was not my thing. We worked tirelessly throughout the season, we won a number of competitions, but one specific one called Feel the Power, where we got our bid to Worldâ€™s - a day I will never forget. This was the first year of this division that was completely new to cheerleading, and I am so glad that I got to be a part of making a name for this team. Worlds was the best cheer experience I have ever had, hands down, we made it to finals, where we placed 7th out of the entire world.

                    <h2 class="mainContentHeaders" title="Grey Reef was the last all star cheerleading team I was ever on. As cheer starts in May, at that point I was just graduating highschool and had decided to take a year off, so I tried out for my dream team, which is an International Open All Girl Level 7 team, the highest level in all of cheerleading. I was stoked to be on my dream team, but I later decided to go to University and thought it would too much to commute from school to cheer all the time and ended up leaving the team before the start of competition season. I was honoured to be on this team for the couple months that I was, and it allowed me to grow so much as an athlete.
