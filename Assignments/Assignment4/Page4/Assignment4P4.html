                    <p id="BrockText">I just started attending Brock University in
                    September 2020.  Based on my years of competitive cheerleading,
                    I was very much hoping to tryout and make the Brock Cheerleading
                    team. Things being very different in this pandemic year, the tryouts
                    (as you can see above) were virtual this year but I did apply, and
                    I had to make a personal video to send as part of the tryouts.
                    Due to Covid-19, the coaches decided not to select and appoint
                    athletes to the Red team or the Blue Team, but everyone remaining
                    is attending the weekly virtual practices that are held. Despite
                    the fact that practices are only virtual, I have still already
                    made some good acquaintances and friends and found I already knew
                    someone from my previous Cheer Sports Sharks teams. Once
                    the pandemic restrictions are lifted and society returns to normal,
                    I am hoping to continue my cheerleading career with the Brock team.</p>
