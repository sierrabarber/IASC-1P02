      One Direction, often shortened to 1D, are an English-Irish pop boy band
      formed in London, England in 2010. The group signed with Simon Cowell's
      record label Syco Records after forming and finishing third in the seventh
      series of the British televised singing competition The X Factor in 2010.
      Propelled to global success by social media, One Direction's five albums,
      Up All Night (2011), Take Me Home (2012), Midnight Memories (2013),
      Four (2014), and Made in the A.M. (2015), topped charts in most major
      markets, and generated hit singles including "What Makes You Beautiful"
      (their first number one on the UK Singles Chart, and the highest debut for
      a British act on the US Billboard Hot 100 since 1998), "Live While We're
      Young", "Best Song Ever", "Story of My Life" and "Drag Me Down". After the
      release of Four, One Direction became the first band in the US Billboard
      200 history to have their first four albums debut at number one. Their
      third album, Midnight Memories, was the best-selling album worldwide of
      2013.
