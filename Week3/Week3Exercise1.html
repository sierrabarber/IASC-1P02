        Orion is a familiar constellation. The apparent positions of its stars in two
        dimensions create a well-known pattern on the bowl of planet Earth's night sky.
        Orion may not look quite so familiar in this 3D view though. The illustration
        reconstructs the relative positions of Orion's bright stars, including data
        from the Hipparcus catalog of parallax distances. The most distant star shown
        is Alnilam. The middle one in the projected line of three that make up Orion's
        belt when viewed from planet Earth, Alnilam is nearly 2,000 light-years
        away, almost 3 times as far as fellow belt stars Alnitak and Mintaka. Though Rigel
        and Betelgeuse apparently shine brighter in planet Earth's sky, that makes more
        distant Alnilam intrinsically (in absolute magnitude) the brightest of the familiar
        stars in Orion. In the Hipparcus catalog, errors in measured parallaxes for Orion's
        stars can translate in to distance errors of a 100 light-years or so.

        A bright storm head with a long turbulent wake swims across Jupiter in these sharp
        telescopic images of the Solar System's ruling gas giant. Captured on August 26, 28,
        and September 1 (left to right) the storm approximately doubles in length during that
        period. Stretching along the jetstream of the planet's North Temperate Belt it travels
        eastward in successive frames, passing the Great Red Spot and whitish Oval BA, famous
        storms in Jupiter's southern hemisphere. Galilean moons Callisto and Io are caught in
        the middle frame. In fact, telescopic skygazers following Jupiter in planet Earth's
        night have reported dramatic fast moving storm outbreaks over the past few weeks in
        Jupiter's North Temperate Belt.
